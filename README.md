Evenstar

Evenstar, a file-based CMS

========

No license YET (so it default to All Right Reserved I guess...), but feel free to browse the code, I'm not done yet :)

UPDATE: I WILL NOW BE WORKING ON AETHERIAN, MY DATABASE CMS. EVENSTAR WILL STILL BE AROUND AND IT WILL BE THE BASE FOR AETHERIAN, BUT IT WILL BE MOSTLY INACTIVE.
